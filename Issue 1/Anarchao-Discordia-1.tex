The (re)discovery of Discordia through anarchism.

\begin{center}
\emph{Dysnomia (Anarchy), Daughter of Eris.}\\
\end{center}

Discordianism and Anarchy always felt to me intrinsically linked by their origins, their ideologies, their authors, their vessels, and their methods. After looking around, it appeared to me that since 1990 with the end of \emph{No Governor}, edited by Robert Shea, no other publication reunited this mother and daughter, and I felt a need to reignite that flame.\\
I felt a need to (re)discover old and new anarchist and discordian thinkers and compile their thoughts and opinions; to see how old ideas from different parts of our world still hold firmly in our current society; to express new ideas about the new openings and new dangers arising for which anarchists and discordians must prepare for.\\

\begin{center}
Anarchao Discordia\\
\end{center}

This first installment of \emph{Anarchao Discordia} mostly focuses on setting the basis of what the readers can expect in the future. It also aims at ``priming the pump" with some great articles from famous authors, laying the foundations of anarcho-discordianism, such as Robert Anton Wilson \& Robert Shea (p.4) and Gregory Hill (p.21); an excellent interview of Cornelius Castoriadis (translated from French) about freedom and the insignificance of modern politics (p.23), considered by Castoriadis as a ``message in a bottle" for future generation (i.e., us); a proto-discordian manifesto on music by John Cage (p.30); and an article, by me, about ``mathematical conspiracy theory" applied to the separation of powers in representative democracy (p.12).\\

If you feel interested in this project, similarly to \emph{No Governor}, \emph{Anarchao Discordia} needs three forms of help:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It needs to be read. Words, thoughts and ideas can only live if they reach minds. I publish \emph{Anarchao Discordia} under a GNU GPLv3 licence, so please, feel \textsc{free} to share and distribute as you please.
\item It needs articles. If you would like to express your opinion and ideas on society, your experience, your strategies and solutions to solve modern plagues, your views on current events, etc. from a anarchist and/or discordian point of view, please contact us.
\item It needs comments and criticisms. Once again, if you want to express your opinion on this journal, this issue, or the articles, please contact us.
\end{enumerate}

My goal, if manageable would consist in publishing an issue of \emph{Anarchao Discordia} every Discordian season. We will see how it goes, but learning from \emph{No Governor}, it might appear difficult. Obviously, I have my own biases as a discordian anarchist, I personally feel strongly attracted to left-wing anarchist ideas and I will try my best to be aware of my own perceptive grid when doing editorial judgments.\\
